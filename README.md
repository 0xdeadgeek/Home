# Hydejack Starter Kit

A quicker way to get started blogging with [Hydejack](https://qwtel.com/hydejack/) on GitHub Pages.


## Steps
1. Fork this repository.
2. Go to **Settings**, rename repository to `<your github username>.github.io` (without the `<` `>`)
3. Edit `_config.yml` (you can do this directly on GitHub)
    1. Change `url` to `https://<your github username>.github.io` (without the `<` `>`)
    2. Change `baseurl` to `''` (empty string)
    3. **Commit changes**!
3. Go to **Settings** again, look for **GitHub Pages**, set **Source** to **master branch**.
4. Click **Save** and wait for GitHub to set up your new blag.
